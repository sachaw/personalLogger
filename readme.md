Two files are requred (ones provided are fine):

- `Personal.json` which can be obtained by using the tools provided in Rei's [repo](https://github.com/Reisyukaku/SwShMod)
- `PersonalSheet.csv` see #assets on the PokeModding discord, file needs to be converted from xlsx to csv

# How To:

- Clone the repo

- `yarn log` or `npm run log`

The output will be saved as `output.json`
